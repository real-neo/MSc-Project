> Suitable for all degree programmes. Project will however involve software development, so students should be comfortable with programming, ideally in Java or C#.

> ### Project
> 
> Throughout the history of Software Engineering, there have been efforts to visualise source code, with the aim of helping people to understand its structure and function. This is usually done by using some analogy. For example, one of the most popular visualisations is “Code City” (https://wettel.github.io/codecity.html), where the source code of a program is turned into a “city”, where blocks of skyscrapers represent code packages, individual sky scrapers represent code files, and their height corresponds to some metric such as Lines of Code.
> 
> One problem with such visualisations is that developers can actually find them quite disorientating. Although the obvious “big” or “complex” files are easy to single out visually, the relative positioning of other smaller, less complex files can be harder to do in a way that will properly orientate the user.
> 
> This project will attempt to work around this problem by developing a new analogy. We will map source code files to real towns and cities (e.g., in the UK). For this, it will be necessary to collect some data on each file (its size / complexity, and the extent to which it calls or references other files).
> 
> Once we have collected this data, it will be necessary to create a mapping, so that each file maps onto a town or city in the UK. However, this mapping should preserve (as much as possible) the size / complexity ordering, and the relative distance between files.
> 
> As a result, it should be possible to take any software system, and to project it onto any country, in such a way that the developer can gain a more intuitive understanding of the relative scale and inter-dependencies between files.
